## What's the purpose of this projuect? What do you want to learn?

The purpose is this project is I have two dogs in my country Korea. They are poodle, but I really do not know about the details of poodle. I would like to learn detail information of poodle, and then I would like to take good care to my lovely dogs. 

What I want to learn is I want to know poodle's average life span of poodle, and poodle's main significant disease. I would like to get ready before they leave me..:(
