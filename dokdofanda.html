	<dd><p><strong>A2.</strong>Onshu shicho goki (Records on Observations in Oki Province), 1667, is one of the earliest Japanese texts that make mention of Matsushima (the old Japanese name for Dokdo). It was written by Toyonobu Saito, a local official of Izumo (today’s eastern part of Shimane prefecture), Japan. The passage pertaining to Dokdo is as follows: </p>

	<dt><p class="lede"><strong>Q3.</strong> How is Dokdo portrayed in early Japanese maps?</p></dt>
	<dd>      <p><strong>A3.</strong>Dokdo does not appear in early maps commissioned by the Japanese government. For instance, Dokdo is missing in Dainihon enkai yochi zenzu (Maps of Japan’s Coastal Areas), 1821, a famous collection of maps made from actual surveys by Tadataka Ino as per orders from the shogunate during the Edo period. Dokdo’s absence in these government-commissioned maps reflects the Japanese government’s recognition of Dokdo as non-Japanese territory. The Japanese government has put forth Kaisei Nihon yochi rotei zenzu (Revised Complete Map of Japanese Lands and Roads), first published in 1779, as evidence of Japan’s sovereignty over Dokdo. However, this is merely a privately drawn map by Sekisui Nagakubo, a Confucian scholar of the Edo period. Furthermore, a quote from Onshu shicho goki
(Records on Observations in Oki Province) appears next to Dokdo (Matsushima) and Ulleungdo (Takeshima) in this map, indicating that the map reflects the understanding of Onshu shicho goki that the Oki Islands is Japan’s northwesternmost boundary. This is also clear from the fact that Ulleungdo
(Takeshima) and Dokdo (Matsushima) are presented differently from Japanese territories in the map’s first edition as well as in the subsequent official editions: Ulleungdo and Dokdo, like mainland Joseon (Korea), are not colored in and are positioned outside the longitudinal and latitudinal lines.</p>

	<dt><p class="lede"><strong>Q4.</strong> What is the “Tottori-han’s Response,” in which it was revealed that Dokdo was not Japanese territory during the dispute over Ulleungdo between Korea and Japan?</p></dt>
	<dd><p><strong>A4.</strong>A diplomatic row between Korea and Japan erupted in 1693 concerning the passage of Japanese fishermen to Ulleungdo (Ulleungdo Dispute). On December 24, 1695, the Edo shogunate sent an inquiry to Tottori-han (feudal clan of Tottori) to determine whether Ulleungdo was a part of Tottori-han and whether there were other islands under Tottori-han’s jurisdiction. The next day, on December 25, Tottori-han responded to the effect that Ulleungdo and Dokdo were not the territories of Japan as follows: “As for Takeshima [Ulleungdo] and Matsushima [Dokdo], neither belongs to the two states [Inaba and Hoki: today’s Tottori prefecture] nor are there any other islands belonging to these two states.” After thus confirming Ulleungdo and Dokdo’s jurisdictional status, the Edo shogunate cancelled the so-called “passage license to Takeshima [Ulleungdo]” on January 28, 1696, prohibiting further passages towards Ulleungdo.</p> <button>Close</button></dd>
    
    	<dt><p class="lede"><strong>Q5.</strong>What is the significance of An Yong-bok’s activities with regard to Dokdo?</p></dt>
	<dd><p><strong>A5.</strong>An Yong-bok, who lived during the reign of King Sukjong of the Joseon dynasty, made two passages to Japan, once against his own will in 1693 when he was captured by the Japanese in Ulleungdo. The 1693 kidnapping of An Yong-bok triggered the Ulleungdo Dispute between Korea and Japan. The kidnapping was significant because the jurisdictional status of Ulleungdo and Dokdo was confirmed in the course of the diplomatic negotiations that ensued. Regarding An Yong-bok’s second passage to Japan in 1696, a record of An Yong-bok’s statement can be found in Sukjong Sillok (Annals of King Sukjong’s Reign). It is recorded that An Yong-bok told the Japanese fishermen he encountered in Ulleungdo that “Matsushima is
Jasando [Dokdo] and it is Korean territory” and that he went over to Japan to lodge a protest against Japan’s encroachment on the Korean territories of Ulleungdo and Dokdo. An Yong-bok’s passages to Japan are recorded not only in Korean but also in Japanese documents, including Takeshima kiji (Records of Takeshima), Takeshima tokai yurai kinuki gaki (Copy of Excerpts from Record of a Trip to Takeshima), Inpu nenpyo (Chronology of Inaba Province), and Takeshimako (Notes on Takeshima). Particularly noteworthy is a historical document
discovered recently in 2005 in Japan entitled “Genroku kyu heishinen chosenbune chakugan ikkan no oboegaki” (Memorandum on the Arrival of a Boat from Joseon in 1696 - a report on An Yong-bok’s visit to the Oki Islands drafted by an official of the island). According to the report, An Yong-bok stated that Ulleungdo and Dokdo belonged to Gangwon-do, which corroborates the information in Sukjong Sillok (Annals of King Sukjong’s Reign).</p>

            	<dt><p class="lede"><strong>Q6.</strong>What was the Joseon (Korean) government’s repatriation policy?</p></dt>
	<dd><p><strong>A7.</strong>The Joseon government dispatched officials to Ulleungdo for the evacuation of the island’s residents to the mainland. This was what is called the repatriation policy. This was one of the island policies adopted by the Joseon government in consideration of the possible raids by Japanese pirates on Joseon’s islands, not an act of relinquishing Joseon’s sovereignty over Ulleungdo. This is evidenced by the fact that the Joseon
government continued to exercise sovereignty over Ulleungdo by dispatching officials to the island. In the early Joseon period, special government agents (sunsimgyeongchagwan) were dispatched to Ulleungdo. During the reign of King Sukjong, the Joseon government implemented a government patrol and
inspection system whereby officials were regularly dispatched to Ulleungdo and other such places. The dispatch of officials continued until the system was discontinued in 1895.</p><button>Close</button></dd>
        
            	<dt><p class="lede"><strong>Q7.</strong>What is the Daijokan Order of 1877, through which the Meiji government officially confirmed that Dokdo was not Japanese territory?</p></dt>
	<dd><p><strong>A7.</strong>In the course of a land registry project during the Meiji period, the Ministry of Home Affairs sent “Inquiry on Takeshima [Ulleungdo] and Another Island [Dokdo] in East Sea as regards the Land Registry Project” to the Daijokan (Grand Council of State), Japan’s highest decision- making body at the time. The Ministry of Home Affairs wanted to determine whether the said islands were to be included in the project. The Daijokan concluded that Ulleungdo and Dokdo did not belong to Japan following the diplomatic negotiations between the Edo shogunate and the Joseon (Korean) government Ulleungdo Dispute). Thereupon, the Daijokan issued a directive to the Ministry of Home Affairs in March 1877. The directive states, “Regarding Takeshima [Ulleungdo] and another island [Dokdo]… bear in mind that our country [Japan] has nothing to do with them.” This is the Daijokan Order of 1877. Along with its note of inquiry, the Ministry of Home Affairs sent Isotakeshima ryakuzu (Simplified Map of Isotakeshima - Japan used to
refer to Ulleungdo as Isotakeshima) as a reference. Given that Takeshima (Ulleungdo) and Matsushima (Dokdo) appear on the map,  it is evident that Dokdo is the “another island” referenced in the phrase “Takeshima [Ulleungdo] and another island” in the Daijokan Order of 1877. The Daijokan Order of 1877 clearly demonstrates the Japanese government’s understanding that the status of Ulleungdo and Dokdo had been confirmed by the conclusion of the Ulleungdo Dispute between the Edo shogunate and the Joseon government in the 17th century. There is also the mention of “how Takeshima [Ulleungdo] and Matsushima [Dokdo] have come under Joseon’s jurisdiction” in “Chosenkoku kosai shimatsu naitansho” (Report on Past Interactions with Joseon). This Ministry of Foreign Affairs report, drafted by Hakubo Sada and a team of officials based on their survey of Joseon, was submitted in 1870, several years before the Daijokan Order of 1877. This report reveals the fact that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs at the time regarded the two islands as Joseon’s territories.</p>

	<dd><p><strong>A8.</strong>In the late 19th century, various problems arose in Ulleungdo, including illegal logging by the Japanese. The government of the Empire of Korea demanded that the Japanese government order the withdrawal of the illegal loggers. The Empire of Korea also decided to strengthen laws pertaining to the local administration of Ulleungdo. On October 24, 1900, the Uijeongbu (State Council) decided that “Ulleungdo shall be renamed Uldo” and “the post of inspector [dogam] shall be changed to county magistrate [gunsu].” The changes were approved by the Emperor on October 25, 1900 and published as Imperial Edict No. 41 in the government’s official gazette on October 27, 1900. Article 2 of Imperial Edict No. 41 stipulates that “as regards the districts, all of Ulleungdo as well as Jukdo and Seokdo [Dokdo] shall be placed under the jurisdiction of [Uldo-gun (Uldo county)],” explicitly including Dokdo among the districts under the jurisdiction of Uldo-gun (Uldo county). Imperial Edict No. 41 evidently demonstrates the historical fact that the government of the Empire of Korea exercised its sovereignty over Dokdo as a part of Ulleungdo.</p>

            	<dt><p class="lede"><strong>Q9.</strong>What was the backdrop against which Japan issued Shimane Prefecture Public Notice No. 40 of 1905, and does this notice carry legal validity under international law?</p></dt>
	<dd><p><strong>A9.</strong>Japan had been at war with Russia over its interests in Manchuria and the Korean peninsula since 1904. Japan’s attempt at incorporating Dokdo into its own territory through Shimane Prefecture Public Notice No. 40 in 1905 was aimed at meeting its military needs in the face of possible maritime clashes with Russia in East Sea. In a related Japanese historical document, it is recorded that the territorial incorporation of Dokdo was being pursued based on the opinion of a Ministry of Foreign Affairs’ official that “building a watchtower and setting up a wireless or submarine telegraph communication system in Takeshima [Dokdo] would be very advantageous in terms of monitoring enemy ships.” Yozaburo Nakai, who petitioned for the territorial incorporation of Dokdo, had initially perceived Dokdo as Korean territory. Also, an official of Japan’s Ministry of Home Affairs stated, “… the disadvantages of arousing the suspicion that Japan harbors the ambition to gobble up Korea outweigh the advantages … by seizing the barren rocks [Dokdo] where not a blade of grass grows and which are considered as belonging to Korea… “ This points to the Japanese government’s recognition of Dokdo as Korean territory. In February 1904, Japan compelled the Empire of Korea to sign the Korea-Japan Protocol to ensure unlimited access to Korean territory in the execution of the Russo-Japanese War. Japan also coerced the Korean government to appoint Japanese and other non-Korean nationals as advisors through the First Korea- Japan Agreement in August 1904. In effect, Japan was systematically implementing its plan to take over Korea, and Dokdo became the first victim to fall prey to Japan’s imperialist ambitions. As is thus shown, Shimane Prefecture Public Notice No. 40 was part of Japan’s systematic plan to undermine Korea’s sovereignty. Japan’s attempt to incorporate Dokdo was an illegal act that infringed upon Korea’s undeniable sovereignty over the island, which had been established over a long period of time. Accordingly, Shimane Prefecture Public Notice No. 40 is null and void under international law.</p><button>Close</button></dd>

Immediately thereafter, on March 29, 1906, Sim Heung-taek submitted a report to the governor of Gangwon-do (Gangwon province) and the Korean Ministry of Home Affairs. On April 29, 1906, Yi Myeong-rae, the county magistrate of Chuncheon-gun (Chuncheon county) and the acting governor of Gangwondo (Gangwon province) reported the matter to the Uijeongbu (State Council of the Empire of Korea). Thereupon, on May 20 of the same year, the Uijeongbu, the top decision-making body of the Empire of Korea, issued the following directive (Directive No. 3):</p>

The third paragraph of the said instruction lists “the four main islands of Japan (Hokkaido, Honshu, Kyushu and Shikoku) and the approximately 1,000 smaller adjacent islands” as the territories of Japan and stipulates the exclusion of “Utsuryo (Ullung) Island, Liancourt Rocks [Dokdo] and Quelpart (Saishu or Cheju) Island.” Moreover, SCAPIN 1033 prohibits Japanese vessels or personnel from coming within 12 nautical miles of Dokdo.</p>

Therefore, the mere fact that Dokdo is not directly mentioned in the said article does not suggest that Dokdo is not included among those territories of Korea separated from Japan.
