	<p><strong>People of Dokdo</strong></p>
	<p class="lede">Currently, population in Dokdo is three. They are Seong-do Kim, the captain of Ship Dokdo, his wife Sin Yeol Kim, and Bu-kyeong Pyeon. Seong-do Kim and his wife moved to Seodo on November 17, 1991 and have been making a living by catching fish.
Their current address is 20-2 Dokdo-ri Ulleung-eup Ulleung-gun, Gyeongsangbuk-do. Poet Bu-kyeong Pyeon moved to Dokdo on November 19, 2003.

Seong-do Kim has been living in Seodo since the 1970s as a crew of Captain Jong Duk Choi, the first resident of Dokdo (Ship Deokjin, 2.22 tons). As a crew, he made a living by gathering seafood and catching fish. 
When Choi died in 1987, Kim began to operate his own ships (Ship Myeongseong, 2.08 tons; Ship Buyeong, 1.5 ton) and settled in Seodo. He eventually moved his permanent address to the current address in 1991.

Jong Duk Choi was the first registered resident of Dokdo. 
As a resident of Ulleungdo Island, he moved to Dokdo in March 1965 to gather seafood in the common fishing ground of Dodong. He began modernizing facilities in May 1968.

When Japan began to claim their ownership of Dokdo in 1980, he moved his permanent address to Dokdo on October 14, 1981, saying, "I will show them that a Korean is living in Dokdo."

His address was San-67 Dodong-ri Ulleung-eup Ulleung-gun, Gyeongsangbuk-do. 
He established an underwater storage and developed abalone fertilization method and a special fishing net. 
Also, he discovered a spring called Mulgol in the heart of Seodo. He tried hard to develop Dokdo until he passed away on September 23, 1987.

Choi's son-in-law, Jun Gi Cho moved into his home on July 8, 1986. Then, he moved to San-63 on February 9, 1991. 
He lived there until he moved to Donghae of Gangwon-do on March 31, 1994. 

Other registered residents of Dokdo who have lived in Dokdo include Jong Chan Choi ('91.6.2 ~'93.6.7), Byung Kwon Kim ('93.1.6~'94.11.7), Sung Woon Hwang ('93.1.7~'94.12.26), and Sang Bo Jun ('94.10.4~'94.12.18).

There are only three people who actually live in Dokdo, 2,051people of 613 households have moved their permanent addresses to Dokdo (as of 2007) through the 'National Dokdo Permanent Address Registration Movement' as we found out Japan was trying to register Dokdo as their land in 1999.</p>

	<p><strong>Offshore Fish Tank of Dokdo</strong></p>
	<p class="lede">The biggest source of income is migratory fishes, such as salmon, trout, codfish, Alaskan Pollack, pacific saury, squid, and shark. When it is squid season in winter, squid gathering lights brightly light up the seas of Dokdo every night.
The Fishing Scene in Offshore Fish Tank of DokdoThe underwater reefs grow much kelp, brown seaweed, spiny turban shells, and abalone and serve as an important source of income. According to the 1981 Study of Professor In Kyu Lee of Seoul National University Department of Botany: 

Dokdo’s underwater vegetation is similar to those of the South Sea, Jejudo Island, other tropical regions of the Northern Hemisphere, and even the Mediterranean, but is very unique that it can be divided into a separate ecosystem.</p>


	<p><strong>Dokdo as the Fishery Base of the East Sea</strong></p>
	<p class="lede">The offshores and Daehwa Bank of Ulleungdo Island and Dokdo are where cool and warm currents interchange and form great fishing grounds. This place is the fishery base of the East Sea that is full of various species of seafood, including squid. The size of catch from this region determines the prices of seafood in Korean market.</p>
