# Korea's Beautiful Island,  Dokdo

Dokdo is the easternmost end of Korea's territories and is located 87.4km to the southeast of Ulleungdo of Korea and 157.5km to the northwest of Oki island of Japan. 

The Dokdo독도/獨島, literally "solitary island", also known as Liancourt Rocks or Takeshima (たけしま/竹島?, literally "bamboo island") in Japanese, are a group of small islets in the Sea of Japan. Sovereignty over the islets is disputed between Japan and South Korea. South Korea classifies the islets as Dokdo-ri, Ulleung-eup, Ulleung County, North Gyeongsang Province. Japan classifies them as part of Okinoshima, Oki District, Shimane Prefecture.
The Franco-English name of the islets derives from Le Liancourt, the name of a French whaling ship which came close to being wrecked on the rocks in 1849.
The Liancourt Rocks consist of two main islets and 35 smaller rocks; the total surface area of the islets is 0.18745 square kilometres (46.32 acres), with the highest elevation of 169 metres (554 ft) found at an unnamed location on the west islet.

## Why you chose that topic and what excites you about it?

The issue of Dokdo to Korean are very sensitive issue in Korea.

Dokdo, the easternmost island in East Sea, is an integral part of Korean territory historically, geographically, and under international law. No territorial dispute exists regarding Dokdo, and Dokdo is not a matter to be dealt with through diplomatic negotiations or judicial settlement.

As I am Korean, I need to explain why Dokdo is Korean territory. That is why I chose this topic.

## What's the purpose of this project? What do you want to learn?

The purpose is this project is as I am a Korean, I need to tell them this unfair situation. I would like to learn all information about Dokdo Island. I will continue to defend Korea's territorial soverelgnty over Dokdo.
