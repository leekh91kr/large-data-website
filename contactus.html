		<p class="lede">We just want to let you know that is <strong>Dokdo</strong> is the easternmost end of Korea's territories and is located 87.4km to the southeast of Ulleungdo of Korea and 157.5km to the northwest of Oki island of Japan. Dokdo, the easternmost island in East Sea, is an integral part of Korean territory historically, geographically, and under international law. No territorial dispute exists regarding Dokdo, and Dokdo is not a matter to be dealt with through diplomatic negotiations or judicial settlement. <strong>Thank you. :)</strong></p>
